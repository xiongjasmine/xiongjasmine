### Hi there! 🥑

I’m Jasmine (she/her) and I’m a second-year computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I love trying new foods, taking afternoon walks, and watching YouTube.

I’ve been programming for about 4 years now, and have picked up different skills from school, work, projects, and hackathons. I’m currently exploring different roles and careers, and aspire to work in the tech industry in the future.
